                                            <p><strong>A great place to start your M.Power Yoga journey.</strong> This non-heated Power Vinyasa Intro class provides more breakdowns and demos for the new student. It is accessible to the beginner, but still challenging for the advanced practitioner. The sequence is the same every time, allowing you to master the poses and feel comfortable before moving on to level two.</p>

Barre is a high-intensity class and you'll notice the benefits even after your first visit. You can find three styles of M.Power Barre on the schedule: Classic Barre, Cardio Barre and Pilates Barre. All 3 formats are accessible to students of any level, beginners are always welcome!</p>

                                  <div class="answer col-md-8">
                                      <p>The definition of Vinyasa is “to place in a special way.” This vigorous and challenging style of yoga is unique because it focuses on connecting breath to movement, flowing from one pose to the next. M•Power’s signature style of Vinyasa not only focuses on flow but also connects poses in a new and creative way. Our advanced classes are creatively yet safely sequenced by our teachers, and are taught in a heated room at 95-97 degrees with 30% humidity.</p>

                                  <h4 class="question col-md-4">Why are classes heated at M·Power?</h4>
                                  <div class="answer col-md-8">
                                      <p>Heat helps create a more challenging cardiovascular workout on the mat, but has many other benefits as well. Heat helps increase flexibility by warming the muscles from the outside inward. It aids in increasing circulation and can help to boost the immune system. Adding heat to a yoga class causes you to be acutely aware and mindful of your breath and your body. If you are overexerting or not breathing enough you will quickly notice and have to adjust.</p>

                                      <p>If you are pregnant and are not a regular practitioner of heated yoga you should not practice in the heat.

                                      <p><span style="color: #000000;">One of the foundations of <span style="color: #363636;">M·Power</span>&nbsp;Yoga is “Motivating Through Creativity.” Music can add a creative and inspiring element to yoga classes.

                                      <p><span style="color: #000000;">Yoga is a Sanskrit word that translates as “union”, or “to yoke.” At M·Power Yoga our goal is to unite your mind, body, and spirit on a deeper level&nbsp;while&nbsp;also uniting&nbsp;you to a supportive community where you can make meaningful connections. We want to inspire you to live your most m•powered and connected life, on and off the mat.</span></p>

It is important to hold a space where you can safely and comfortably disconnect from the outside world and enjoy the full hour of “you time.” We lock the doors while classes are in session for the safety and respect of our students who are practicing. Please allow enough time to check in and arrive on your mat before the class is scheduled to begin.</span></p>
